## Specification Deliverable  

### Elevator Pitch ðŸ›—  
Have you ever wondered how well you know your friendsâ€™ niche opinions? Rank It is the ultimate social guessing game where players compete to match their friendsâ€™ opinions on dynamic, creative scales. From scales like "disgusting to delicious" to "old-fashioned to modern", Rank It keeps everyone engaged with fun clues, real-time voting, and friendly competition. Create or join a game, and see how well you know each other!

### Design
The app has three primary views:  
1. **Login Page**: Securely log in or create an account to start playing.  
2. **Game Setup Page**: Create or join a game using a unique code.  
3. **Game Page**: Displays the scale, countdown timer, player sliders, and live scoreboard.  

Mockup images of the Game Page for desktop and mobile are attached below:

Here is a sequence diagram showing interactions between players, the backend, and WebSocket when voting.

### Key Features ðŸ”‘
- Secure login over HTTPS.  
- Create or join a game with up to 8 players.  
- Unique scales fetched from the database for every round.

### Technologies  

**HTML**  
Provides structure for login, game setup, and gameplay pages with form inputs, dynamic scoreboards, and interactive elements.  

**CSS**  
Ensures responsive design and styling with animations for voting interactions.  

**React**  
Manages state and routing between views with reusable components and real-time updates.  

**Service**  
Backend service with endpoints for:  
- `login`: Authenticates users securely.  
- `fetchScales`: Retrieves unique scales from the database.  
- `submitClue`: Allows the "it" player to submit a clue.  
- `submitVotes`: Processes and stores player votes for scoring.  
- External API: Filters inappropriate clues using a moderation API.  

**Database/Login**  
Stores user accounts, hashed credentials, game data, and tracks used scales for unique rounds.  

**WebSocket**  
Broadcasts real-time slider updates, locked-in results, and live game events to all players.  


## HTML Deliverable

I added a Statistics page, but other than that, I stuck to my original plan. Below shows what I implemented.

- [x] **HTML pages** - Four HTML pages were created to represent key components of the application:
  - `index.html`: Home and login page.
  - `create_or_join.html`: Page for creating or joining a game.
  - `play.html`: Gameplay page.
  - `statistics.html`: Statistics page displaying user game data.
- [x] **Links** - Navigation links connect all pages via the `<nav>` menu. Links allow seamless transitions between the home, game setup, gameplay (only accessible by joining or creating a game), and statistics pages.
- [x] **Text** - Informative textual content includes:
  - Game rules and how-to-play guide (`create_or_join.html`).
  - Gameplay details (`play.html`).
  - User statistics (`statistics.html`).
- [x] **Images** - Images such as `logo.png` and `user_black.svg` are used in headers and forms across all pages.
- [x] **3rd Party API Calls** - The API will be called on the clue input field in (`play.html`), and the response will be displayed to everyone. You can check the code for more details by searching for "API".
- [x] **DB/Login** - Placeholders for database data are present:
  - Login form with username and password fields in `index.html`.
  - Game-related data like clue scales in `play.html`.
  - Player statistics such as games played and total points in `statistics.html`.
- [x] **WebSocket** - Real-time updates are planned and indicated:
  - Dynamic clue and vote updates in `play.html` using WebSocket placeholders.

## CSS Deliverable

I properly styled my application to achieve its final appearance. It included some changes to the HTML as well.

- [x] **Header, footer, and main content body** - Ensured consistent styling across the applicationâ€™s layout.
- [x] **Navigation elements** - Customized anchor element colors to match my startup's theme.
- [x] **Responsive to window resizing** - The app is fully responsive, providing an optimal experience on all window sizes and devices.
- [x] **Application elements** - Applied good contrast and whitespace to enhance readability and visual hierarchy.
- [x] **Application text content** - Maintained consistent font usage for a cohesive design, and used proper headings.
- [x] **Application images** - Styled the icon images to maintain their size and move accordingly, and animated the stars images.

## React Deliverable Phase 1: HTML/CSS

I used React to build out the components and structure of my application from my HTML and CSS files.

- [x] **Bundled using Vite** - done!
- [x] **Created Components** - I created React components containing the HTML and CSS for each of my 4 main pages.
      - Note, the play page is only accessible by joining or creating a game on the home page.
- [x] **React Router** - Implemented BrowserRouter and a Route for each page. Also updated the form logic to navigate between pages properly.

## React Deliverable Phase 2: Reactivity 

For this deliverable I used React so that the application works, and I also added placeholders for future technology, that use randomization and occasional timed updates to look realistic.

- [x] **All functionality implemented or mocked out** - Everything is working! Users and games are stored in a global context. `setInterval` used to simulate other player voting.
- [x] **Hooks** - Used `useState` and `useEffect` for each page, and created a custom hook/context useGame.

## Service deliverable

For this deliverable I added backend endpoints that create games, join players to games, and manage user stats.

- [x] **Node.js/Express HTTP service** - done!
- [x] **Static middleware for frontend** - done!
- [ ] **Calls to third party endpoints** - I didn't have time to implement this.
- [x] **Backend service endpoints** - Placeholders for login that stores the current user in the app context. Endpoints for game creation and joining.
- [x] **Frontend calls service endpoints** - I did this using the fetch function.
- [X] **Supports registration, login, logout, and restricted endpoint** - Supports registration, login, and logging out. Restriction is applied to the endpoints.

## DB/Login deliverable

For this deliverable I associate the statistics with the logged in user. I stored the users and stats in the database.

- [x] **Stores data in MongoDB** - Done!
- [x] **Use MongoDB to store credentials** - Stores users and their statistics. Games are not stored, since they are designed to only last temporarily, and are placeholders for the websocket deliverable.
